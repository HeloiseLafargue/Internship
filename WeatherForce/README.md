### Data Scientist in Meteorology at WeatherForce 💧🌦️🇵🇪

June 2023 - August 2023, Toulouse

💧Meteorology for Peruvian agriculture💧

- 🌦️ As part of a collaborative project with ESA Space Solutions, I was lucky enough to join the team at WeatherForce, a company delivering weather intelligence around the world, for a 3-month internship. This internship provided me with the opportunity to immerse myself in the field of meteorology and climate.

- 🇵🇪 My assignment was to evaluate the performance of seasonal forecasting models applied to monitoring water reserves, using watersheds of northern Peru as a specific case study. The agricultural areas of Peru, which are climatologically arid, are very sensitive to droughts and floods. Rainfall is therefore the meteorological element that requires the most monitoring, particularly with regard to irrigation management, which is all the more important in a context of global climate change and a region subject to fluctuations in the El Niño Southern Oscillation.

- 💧 The use of seasonal rainfall and river flow forecasts, along with their anomalies, provides a better long-term view of water reserve management.

- 👩🏻‍💻 In this context, I was able to evaluate the products of Copernicus ECMWF C3S (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Copernicus Climate Change Service) seasonal precipitation forecasts and GloFAS (Global Flood Awareness System) river flow forecasts over the geographical area of interest in order to provide the client with anomaly maps for the next 6 months, with recommendations that would support their decisions.

- 🗣️ Finally, I had the opportunity to present a data-visualisation with a mock-up to the Peruvian pilot customers in Spanish.

- 👥 I would like to thank Martin Espitalié, who guided me throughout this course, for his expertise in meteorology and climatology, Christine David and Pascal Venzac, for their trust, and the whole team, especially Grassi Kelly, Iñigo Reizabal Arregui and Arthur Albaz.
