# Apprenticeship in Artificial Intelligence applied to Altimetry

Sept. 2023 - Sept. 2024, CLS, Environment & Climate BU, Toulouse, France

- Analyze and develop an alternative method for estimating the SSB model (sea
state bias) in N dimensions to adapt to new generation altimetry missions
(SWOT, Sentinel-3 NG, etc.).

- Establish a new tool for calculating SSB correction using a non-parametric
method and a method based on nested neural networks (PyTorch).
