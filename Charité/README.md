### Research Assistant at Charité Berlin
June 2022 - August 2022

- In summer 2022 I had the opportunity to join a research group for an 8-week internship in Berlin at the Institute of Computer-assisted Cardiovascular Medicine, Charité – University Medicine Berlin.
Kown as one of the best medical research institutions and hospital in the world, Charité Berlin was the perfect place to discover a new field of computer science application and a new country.

- I studied the functioning of the left atrium and made a 3d model of it based on real data and statistical studies.

- I would like to thank my internship tutors Katharina Vellguth and Lukas Obermeier for giving me the chance to work with them on an advanced heart model, extending it with left atrium behavior simulations.
In this time, I established a new workflow to process patient specific left atrial geometries with the Python package Deformetrica in the context of geometry registration, time series registration, and shape atlas construction.  I could develop my skills in Data Analysis and Visual Computing, relating with my courses at ENSEEIHT.
